# Etch-A-Sketch

## Third project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) curriculum.

Practicing DOM a step further combining everything I learned so far about HTML,CSS and JS, implementing a user interface calculator which performs all the capabilities found on all simple calculators, It should be able to receive an input of numbers and basic mathematical operations (+, - , \*, /) and evaluate the input accurately. **The calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time.** Additionally, the [eval() function should not be used.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#Never_use_eval!)

### Goals/Features:

- [ ] Create an interactive calculator with a display that reflects user input.
- [ ] Show previous answer or user input while displaying current input
- [ ] Buttons to take in user input for all basic mathematical operations (add, subt, mult, divide)
- [ ] A decimal (.) button so that users can input numbers with decimal places.
- [ ] Keyboard support so that numbers do not have to be clicked on screen.

### Learning Outcomes:

- [ ]Further practiced CSS especially borders and outlines
- [ ]Focused on JS more than the design aspect (CSS)

### Future features:

- [ ] Additional buttons and functionality like exponents ( ^ ) square root( √ ) log and ln as well as factorials (!) , clear display (CE) and backspace (⌫)
